Hi <%- name %>!

This is a template, it's built using a library called Embedded JS (EJS).

This means that I can pass the data you're inputing and include it in this text.

The data on this page comes from a github repository called `credo`.

You could show this working by pushing a change in this file, either in github or locally:


__Change this text__
