# Welcome

This is simple starter repo to help you add Credo to your projects.

Fork this repository and go to `credo.dev/github/<your_github_username>/workflow/welcome` to get started.

### What is Credo?

Credo is a way of sharing knowledge about code which allows you to:
- Write templates for your code using EJS
- Gather requirements and pass them into your templates in what we call a `workflow`

The [Credo Web App](https://www.credo.dev) looks for a public repository on your github account with the name `credo` and uses the data stored there to allow you to play around with your `workflow`s.
